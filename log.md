# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 28, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Read some Medium articles on 100days, coding and linux. Worked on the HTMl/CSS
frontend course in FreeCodeCamp. Listened to a crapton of hella good electronic on Pandora! Also ran
through the little tutorial thing on Github, as well as read about github Markdown. 

**Thoughts:** Had the revelation last night that a programming language, although very Mathy, can probably
be learned equally well as a *language* than as a mathematics. Good for non math people. 
Need to figure out what all this markdown shit means so I can write decent looking docu's.
